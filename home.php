As a community leader and educator here in Northeast Florida, I’m committed to helping our region grow economically while preserving the quality of life we value. That economic growth and quality of life are both based on the great natural opportunities with which our region is blessed – our position as a leading port, and our tremendous marine, agricultural, and wildlife resources – as well as our people, who have made Northeast Florida a prime location for trade and finance, for biomedicine and health care, and for hospitality.  All of these competitive advantages should be helping Northeast Florida to grow jobs every day of every year – what’s holding us back is politics, and that has to change.
 <br><br>
We need someone to go to Tallahassee to fight for our interests, the same way I fought for America’s interests at the White House and the United Nations.  Someone who will cross the aisle to get things done, the same way I did in Washington.  And someone who will bring new ideas to creating jobs and economic growth, the same way I have seen in our competitors around the globe.  I have a forward-looking plan for bringing jobs and growth to Northeast Florida, built on my experience here in our region and around the world – and the dedication to make it work.
<br><br>
In Tallahassee, I will fight to make the implementation of Panamax standards and other needed infrastructure investments at the Port of Jacksonville the state’s Number One priority.  I will also work with our representatives in Washington on federal funding for our ports and airports, and to keep military jobs here in Northeast Florida.  I will push for trade financing and export support programs, legislation to streamline the process for international banks and other global businesses to set up operations in Florida, and expansion of venture capital and other capital-access programs for small businesses.  I will fight for a common-sense approach to fisheries conservation, for funding for biotech research and development, and for support of our tourist industry. 
 <br><br>
All of these efforts will require an ability to reach across party lines and work at all levels – regional, state, federal, and, in some cases, even internationally – to build consensus and broaden opportunities for Northeast Florida.  And all of these efforts require something else to bring these economic opportunities to fruition: an appreciation for the central importance of education to competing in today’s global economy.  As an educator, I know first-hand what we need to do to ensure that we are preparing a Florida workforce that can meet 21st Century demands, that we are leveraging our community colleges and local institutions of higher learning to produce jobs, that we are keeping higher education affordable for everyone in our region, and that our public schools are preparing students for the 21st Century workforce by raising standards and promoting meaningful accountability. 
 <br><br>
These are the issues I have spent my career working on – both around the world, and here at home in Northeast Florida.  It is why I want to go to Tallahassee now, to work for our community, our schools, and our jobs, and why you can count on me to make change work.
 <br><br>
I hope I can count on you for your support.
